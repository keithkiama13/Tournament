      <p>A persistent lower back injury has denied Paula Badosa the chanceto compete in front
         of her home fans at the Mutua Madrid Open.</p>
      <p>On friday, ahead of her scheduled second-round meeting with Veronika Kudermetova,
         the No. 9 seed withdrew from the combined 1000-level event.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to let you know that unfortunately I won't be to play (the) Mutua Madrid
         Open. I've tired to do everything possible until the last moment because you know how
         excited I am to play at home, but it's being a complicated injury, I hope to be 100% soon,"
         Badosa wrote on her instagram story.</p>
      <p>A former world No, 2, Badosa made a triumphant return in 2024 after a stress fracture in her back nearly
         pushed her to walk away from the sport winning the WTA 500 in Washington, D.C. and adding a US Open
         quarterfinal
         among a string of strong showings in the latter third of the season. In,January, she defeated CoCo Gauff to
         reach
         her first major semifinal at the Austrailian Open, a run that propelled Badosa back inside Top 10.</p>
      <p>But the past two months have been tough goings for the spaniard. A back injury flared up during her
         Merida quarterfinal in late February, timing that ultimately ruled out Badosa out of Indian Wells. She won a
         pair of matches
         at the Miami Open before citing back problem as the reason for her withdrawal prior to a fourth-round encounter
         with Alexandra Eala.</p>

      <p>Carlos Alcaraz couldn't take the court at the Mutua Madrid Open last week due to injury,
         but his presence was felt all over the Caja Magica ahead of the release of his new Netflix
         minstries.</p>
      <p>Spanning three episodes and documenting his 2024 season on and off the court, Carlos
         Alcaraz. My way offers a candid look at the whirlwind life of one of the world's top tennis
         players. Alcaraz also gets real about the pressures that he's under-both from the sports
         world wanting him to become 'The Next Rafael Nadal' to meeting his own team's high
         expectations.</p>
      <p>Already have the youngest ATP WORLD No.1 of all time, the 21-year-old has lifted four Grand
         Slams to date and seems poised to rack up more. But sometimes, all he wants to do is hang out with his friends at a formula 1 race, or cut loose
         and forget his worries in Ibiza. The series documents Alcaraz's search for balance through it all, as he seeks to go about his
         career and personal life in 'his way'.</p>
       <p>Here are 6 things we learned about the kid from Muricia thanks to Netflix:</p>
       <h2  style="font-family: 'Inter',sans-serif;font-size:48px;">1.He still sleeps on a twin-sized bed at his parent's house.</h2>
       <p>Alcaraz recently surpassed $40 million in career prize money-but he's not the kind  of guys who splashes out on a flashy
          penthouse in a tax haven with nice weather.</p>
      <p>In fact Alcaraz, who goes by "Charlie" or Carlitos" among friends and family, still lives at home with his parents in El Palmar,
         Muricia. And he's got no intention of charging that,either.</p>
       <p>"I come here after every tournament," Alcaraz explains. "This is my quiet place...I could live on my own, but I like being around 
           my family. I like being around my parents."</p>
       <p>In the series' opening episode, 'Finding Joy in the Pain', viewers get a tour of his small bedroom, which includes his twin-sized
          pressed against one wall and shelves stuffed full of his sneaker collection and trophy haul on the other. His Grand Slam trophies
         occupy a prime spot at the top of his parents' living room shelf-at least for now.</p>
         <h3 style="font-family: 'Inter',sans-serif;font-size:48px;">2.Jannik Sinner is "the toughest player you can compete against."</h3>
      <p>Since My way delves into Alcaraz's 2024 season, it's no surprise that rival Jannik Sinner features prominently throughout the three
         times last season, with the Spaniard going 3-0 against the world No.1.</p>
      <P>Alcaraz heaps praise on Sinner, and says his opponent "motivates me to better'-a sentiment that Sinner completely agree with.</P>
      <p>The Italian even makes a brief cameo as a talking head to shed light on their rivalry, praising Alcaraz's mental strength for playing
         cramps in their Roland Garros semifinal and pevalling in a three-set classic in the Beinjing final.</p>
      <p>"Me and Carols, we have a great rivalry,"Sinner says. "When we play, there's a bit more extra attention and, from our side, a bit more tension.</p>
      <p>He won Masters events, as I did, and he won Grand Slams. While he's winning, I feel like my practice sessions are getting more intense."</p>
